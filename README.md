Number guessing games are classic and fun! They typically involve a player trying to guess a randomly chosen number within a certain range. Hereâ€™s a basic rundown of how they work:

Setup:

The game chooses a secret number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100). The player is usually informed of the range but not the number. Guessing:

The player makes a guess about what the secret number is. After each guess, the game provides feedback, often indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Feedback:

If the guess is too high, the game might say, "Too high! Try again." If the guess is too low, it might say, "Too low! Try again." If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and often displays the number of attempts it took. Winning:

The game ends when the player guesses the correct number. Some versions keep track of the number of guesses and might give a score based on how quickly the number was guessed. Replayability:

After winning, players can often start a new game with a different secret number.
